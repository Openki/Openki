**Platform for open education** – Free software built with [Meteor.js](http://meteor.com)

An interactive web-platform to provide barrier-free access to education for everyone.
It is a simple to use open-source tool for local, self-organized knowledge-exchange:
As a foundation for mediating non-commercial education opportunities,
as interface between people who are interested in similar subjects,
and as an instrument which simplifies the organization of “peer-to-peer” sharing of knowledge.

<br>
Beside the longterm public installations, Openki can be used at unconferences, BarCamps as well as in democratic schools and participatory festivals.
